d 'estdocx':program proving same functionality as estimates table but exports results directly to a Wordtable
d
d The command putdocx in Stata 15 provide a native implementation for exporting estimates
d trough the command docx table results = etable.
d However, using etable directly after estimates store causes unwanted formatting issues in the resulting table. E.g. hidden characters in cells
d making formating of the table in MSWord difficult. This implementation avoid such issues and allows some
d additional benefits by providing options for the formating of the resulting table, automatic inclusion of
d legend etc.
